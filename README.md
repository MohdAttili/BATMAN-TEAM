## Project Overview
This repository contains all the engineering materials, code, schematics, and models related to our self-driven vehicle, designed and built to participate in the WRO Future Engineers 2025 competition. The project aims to develop an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a predefined course while demonstrating precision, stability, and effective control of electromechanical components.

Our vehicle is a compact, versatile model incorporating both mechanical and electronic systems. It is designed to efficiently demonstrate autonomous navigation using sensors, motor control, and a central microcontroller. The design and implementation of this project involved detailed planning, testing, and iterative improvements to meet the strict requirements of the competition.
